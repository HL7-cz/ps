### Overview

The Patient Summary is a standardized set of key health information about a patient that is essential for ensuring continuity and safety of the care provided. It includes core patient data, allergies, diagnoses, medication, immunizations, and significant medical conditions. Its purpose is to quickly provide an overview of the patient’s health status when encountering a new healthcare provider, both within a single country and in a cross-border context.
