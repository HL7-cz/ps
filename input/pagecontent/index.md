### Introduction

This implementation guide is based on FHIR version R4. It defines a set of HL7 FHIR rules specifying how to represent the Patient Summary in the Czech national context, in line with the European eHN guidelines.

Its main objective is to define the content components and the preferred structure to be used when constructing a Patient Summary. The purpose of this standard is to define the representation of the Patient Summary as part of the patient’s medical record for the electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers, and healthcare infrastructure in the Czech Republic.

This guide does not describe how this document is to be exchanged.
